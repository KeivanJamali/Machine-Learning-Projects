metr-la.h5: This dataset contains traffic speed and volume collected from
the highway of the Los Angeles County road network, with 207 loop detectors.
The samples are aggregated in 5-minute intervals. The most frequently
referenced time period for this dataset is from March 1st to June 30th, 2012.

pems-bay.h5: This dataset contains raw detector data from over 18,000 vehicle detector stations on the freeway system spanning all major metropolitan areas of California from 2001 to 2019, collected with various sensors including inductive  loops, side-re radar, and magnetometers. The samples are captured every 30 seconds and aggregated in 5-minute intervals. Each data sample contains a timestamp, station ID, district, freeway ID, direction of travel, total 
ow, and average speed. Different subsets of PeMS data have been used in previous studies, for example: â€¢ PeMS-BAY 4: This subset contains data from 325 sensors in the Bay Area from January 1st to June 30th, 2017.

Seattle Loop: This dataset was collected by inductive loop detectors deployed
on four connected freeways (I-5, I-405, I-90, and SR-520) in the Seattle
area, from January 1st to 31st, 2015. It contains the traffuc speed data from 323
detectors. The samples are aggregated in 5-minute intervals.
